Therefore, methods like append() or remove() do not exist in the operations of this type.\n","\n","Tuples are commonly used for small collections of values that will not need to change, such as an IP address and port. If we have unchanged data, we should choose tuples because it is much faster than lists.\n","\n","We used square brackets üëâüèª'[]' to define the lists.
